            <h5 class="card-title">Warzone 1.0</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Also known as the Golden Age of Warzone, this was Raven Studio's smash hit that appeared out of nowhere and finally tapped into the free to play playerbase. During the release of their third installment of the remastered franchise, Call of Duty: Vanguard, the playerbase started to drop by a few thousand which caused a shift at Activison leading to a complete reboot of the already succseful battle royale.</p>

              <h5 class="card-title">Warzone 2.0</h5>
              <p class="card-text">At this point in time, Call of Duty has been on a downward trend since the release of Call of Duty: Vanguard, and with their newest installment, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2(2022), not being as well recieved due to the shift into a more realistic stlye of gameplay over their usuall arcade shooter formula, this lead to a large number of layoffs at all 3 of their studios and an increased use of AI to generate in-game cosmetics which only excacerbated the playerbases frustration with Activision.</p>

                <h5 class="card-title">Warzone 3.0</h5>
                <p class="card-text">Even after the majority of issues were fixed with Warzone 3.0, the damage was already done with Activision running on a complete skeleton crew and watching their numbers fall further. Due to the lack of actualy devs, Activision has cut some corners in designing the game such as releasing their unfinished anti-cheat which doesn't work fully, server-side issues which can make the game unbearable to play at times, and the lack of gun balancing which leaves the gameplay feeling a bit bland.</p>

              <p class="card-text">The first entry into the new remastered trilogy of games, coming out of nowhere and being built on an entirely different game engine, the game absolutely took off in popularity push Call of DUty into the mainstream. COVID-19 was a huge factor in its popularity, with lockedowns creating a higher demand for things to do at home.</p>

                <p class="card-text">This installment really wasn't anything special in terms of the franchise and didn't try to deviate from the original formula. The Competitive scene was still thriving and the game had a top 7 most successful launch for Activision.</p>

                  <h5 class="card-title">Call of Duty: Vanguard</h5>
                  <p class="card-text">A STRONG contender for one of the worst Call of Duty Games of all time, Sledge Hammer Studios tried to incorporate dynamic map elements to revolutionize how the game should be played. Although they had the right idea of increasing the skill gap among players, they did it in such a way that it actually had the opposite affect, angering their players to the point they started boycotting Activision and their studios.</p>

                    <h5 class="card-title">Modern Warfare II</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">With Activision's favorite studio, Raven Software, being back at the helm, they tried to make significant changes to try and appeal to what they thought would be a more profitable demographic. Adding heavy movement penalties caused the game to shift to a more tactical form of gameplay which the playerbase hated.</p>

                <h5 class="card-title">Modern Warfare III</h5>
                <p class="card-text">Being considered more or less a DLC for the wildly unpopular MWII, somehow this game flipped the audience's view on the franchise on its head, giving Activision the incentive to continue making Call of Duty games. </p>

              <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
                <li class="list-group-item">Weapon balancing was some of the most optimized it has been in years, helping to win the favor of the playerbase.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">First game in the 2 year dev-cycle Activison set for its studios after MWII.</li>

                <h5 class="card-title">Black Ops 6</h5>
                <p class="card-text">The most current game in the series, Activision really started to change and have some fun with the usual formula. Bringing back round based zombie maps, and switching the current movement system to be more omni-movement based. With the lack of an actual functioning anti-cheat, many players have expressed their frustration with the dev studios but every complaint seems to go unheard resulting in a heavy drop off of active players.</p>
