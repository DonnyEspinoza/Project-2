            <h5 class="card-title">Warzone 1.0</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Also known as the Golden Age of Warzone, this was Raven Studio's smash hit that appeared out of nowhere and finally tapped into the free to play playerbase. During the release of their third installment of the remastered franchise, Call of Duty: Vanguard, the playerbase started to drop by a few thousand which caused a shift at Activison leading to a complete reboot of the already succseful battle royale.</p>

              <h5 class="card-title">Card title</h5>
              <p class="card-text">At this point in time, Call of Duty has been on a downward trend since the release of Call of Duty: Vanguard, and with their newest installment, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2(2022), not being as well recieved due to the shift into a more realistic stlye of gameplay over their usuall arcade shooter formula, this lead to a large number of layoffs at all 3 of their studios and an increased use of AI to generate in-game cosmetics which only excacerbated the playerbases frustration with Activision.</p>

                <h5 class="card-title">Warzone 3.0</h5>
                <p class="card-text">Even after the majority of issues were fixed with Warzone 3.0, the damage was already done with Activision running on a complete skeleton crew and watching their numbers fall further. Due to the lack of actualy devs, Activision has cut some corners in designing the game such as releasing their unfinished anti-cheat which doesn't work fully, server-side issues which can make the game unbearable to play at times, and the lack of gun balancing which leaves the gameplay feeling a bit bland.</p>
