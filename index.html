          <h2>Use the Proper Equipment</h2>
          <p>Using the right tools for the job is how you can get the drop on your enemy. In a game where outplaying your opponent wins you more fights than facing them head on, having a variety of tools at your disposal and the most optimal attachments equipped to your gun will give you more choices on how to apporach a fight.</p>

          <h2>Teamplay is Crucial</h2>
          <p>Call of Duty is a TEAM based game, you can't do everything on your own, So having any amount of communication is beneficial. Whether it's through pings or the in game voice chat, being able to talk to and organize with your teammates to push back the enemy team is important.</p>

        <h2>Awareness wins fights</h2>
        <p>Having a general idea of spawn locations and rush routes can go a long way while playing. Being able to put pressure on enemy team pushes, hold choke points, pinch areas of the map, cut off lanes, and play objective all at the same time is no easy task but being able to balance so many factors at the same time can give you the edge more often than not.</p>

        <h2>A Positive Attitude is Key</h2>
        <p>Going into a fight and or game thinking you're gonna lose has a way of bringing down team morale, mainfesting that outcome. Everyone has the same health so the best way to win games is to not put yourself down before it starts.</p>
